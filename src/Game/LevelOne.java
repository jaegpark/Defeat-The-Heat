/**
 * This class creates the window and graphics for level one of Defeat the Heat. The player must find all the fire

 * <b> Time spent modifying file: </b> 0.5 hours
 * <p>
 * <b> Total time spent writing file: </b> 11.5 hours
 * <p>
 * <b> Modification summary: </b>
 * An instructions window is now opened at the beginning of the level. The instructions window and win/lose window
 * are now fixed to the JFrame even upon moving the JFrame. The constructor has been altered to allow all level one
 * graphics to be displayed on a single JFrame shared between levels. The main method has been removed.
 * <p>
 * <b> Instance Variables: </b>
 * <p>
 * <b> frame </b> The JFrame on which the Level One graphics are displayed
 * <p>
 * <b> label </b> The JLabel storing the image for the Level One background.
 * <p>
 * <b> image </b> A BufferedImage object storing the level one background.
 * <p>
 * <b> t </b> The TimeDisplay object that is created to add a timer onto the window.
 * <p>
 * <b> rulesDialog </b> The JDialog displaying the rules of level one.
 * <p>
 * <b> infoDialog </b> The JDialog that pops up upon a hazard being clicked. Only one is active at a time.
 * <p>
 * <b> endDialog </b> Stores the JDialog that is shown when the game is won or lost.
 * <p>
 * <b> hazardNames </b> A List that stores the names of the hazards.
 * <p>
 * <b> hazardsFound </b> A boolean array whose indexes correspond with those of hazardNames. Indicates which hazards are found.
 * <p>
 * <b> allHazardsFound </b> A boolean variable indicating whether or not all hazards have been found by the player.
 * <p>
 * <b> rulesClosed </b> Indicates whether the instructions have been closed and the game can begin.
