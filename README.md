# Defeat-The-Heat

As a culminative project, my friend Rohan and I developed DefeatTheHeat in Java, using imported swing and awt libraries. 
It teaches users about fire safety, through three levels (learning, application, extension). The user navigates the game using keyboard and mouse I/O.

Rather than having a large game class, we used Object-Oriented Programming techniques of creating multiple classes that worked together. 

For one month, we divided the work like so:

Rohan:
- Levels One and Two.
- Graphics for those respective levels.

Jae (myself):
- Level Three (maze).
- Main menu navigation and graphics.
- Putting the game together, including intricacies like the pause menu.


To run the game, ensure that a JRE version 8 or newer is installed on the device.

Caution: Very low resolutions may cause off screen text in the third level.
