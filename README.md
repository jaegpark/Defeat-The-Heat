# Defeat-The-Heat

As a culminative project, my friend Rohan and I developed in Java, using imported swing and awt libraries. 
It teaches users about fire safety, through three levels (learning, application, extension). The user navigates the game using keyboard and mouse I/O.

Rather than having a large game class, we used Object-Oriented Programming techniques of creating multiple classes that worked together. 

For one month, we divided the work like so:

Rohan:
- Levels One and Two.
- Graphics for those respective levels.

Jae (myself):
- Level Three (maze).
- Main menu navigation and graphics.
- Putting the game together, including intricacies like the pause menu.


To run the game, ensure that a JRE version 8 or newer is installed on the device.

Caution: Very low resolutions may cause off screen text in the third level.
