# Defeat-The-Heat

This is a game I developed in Java, using imported swing and awt libraries.

It teaches users about fire safety, and takes in keyboard and mouse I/O.


To run the game, ensure that a JRE version 8 or newer is installed on the device.

A caution: Very low resolutions may cause off screen text in the third level.
